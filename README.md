Here's a breakdown of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. Moving Object Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect moving objects in a video stream using OpenCV.  It utilizes background subtraction techniques to identify and track objects in motion.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Background subtraction using various algorithms (e.g., MOG2, KNN).
    *   Object contour detection and bounding boxes.
    *   Real-time video processing.
*   **Technologies:** OpenCV, Python
  
### 2. Advanced Face Detection and Tracking

This project goes beyond basic face detection and implements robust face tracking. It uses Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors and incorporates tracking algorithms to maintain the identity of detected faces across frames.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning models (e.g., SSD, MTCNN).
    *   Face tracking using KCF, CSRT, or other suitable trackers.
    *   Facial landmark detection (optional).
*   **Technologies:** OpenCV, Python

### 3. Object Tracking based on Color with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to track objects based on their color in a video stream.  It allows you to select a target color range and then tracks objects that fall within that range.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Color space conversion (e.g., HSV).
    *   Color-based object segmentation.
    *   Object tracking using centroid or other methods.
*   **Technologies:** OpenCV, Python

### 4. Face Recognition with OpenCV

This project implements face recognition using OpenCV.  It covers the process of training a face recognizer on a dataset of faces and then using the trained model to identify individuals in new images or video streams.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Face detection.
    *   Face encoding/feature extraction (e.g., using FaceNet, LBPH, Eigenfaces).
    *   Face recognition using a trained classifier.
    *   Dataset management (optional).
*   **Technologies:** OpenCV, Python
